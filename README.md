# Dogwalkers

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Goal:
This website will help a rescue charity manage their dog walker's schedule. 

## Usecase: 
Dogwalker Coordinators will log into website using Auth0.  
They will create schedules which show monthly or weekly overviews of dogwalking.   
They will add the current dogs in the charity with their walking requirements.   
They will invite dog walkers to see the schedules and possibly allow edits.   
If edits are allowed, dogwalkers can log in, select the appropriate schedule and update their availability.   
Volunteers will see which dogs can be walked and what requirements may have changed.  
The schedule will highlight days where too few volunteers have signed up.
